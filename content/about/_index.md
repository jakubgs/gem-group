# GEM Group

Company Gem Group was established in 1989.
It was founded with a group of my friends and colleagues heartfelt wave of "pre-revolutionary" changes in the Polish economy.
We took matters into our own hands, believing that tin he new reality will succeed.
In 1992, I took over complete control of the Company and to this day its accompanied me in my career.


Often I left the Game Group, because many business challenges attracted me enough to work for different companies.
Always I was able to change the company for the better. This was also due to motivated team of my colleagues.
When I made career step to be an employee, I can count on my co-workers in the company, knowing that they will continue my work.
Gem Group is also for me a safe haven in times of changing jobs, or fatigue corporate work culture.
Whether as an employee or as a consultant, I still want to change the companys for better and make them market leaders.


I can always count on the people with whom cooperation has shown that we share the same values and ideals, and it's not about business at all costs.
Twenty-one years shows that GEM Group significantly differ from other consulting firms in the field of Human Resources Management.
We have principles, we have experience and the invoice is not the only measure of our success.
It was this way in the past, so it is now and will always be.
